# turing
A Discord bot with many different functions and the goal of eventually imitating an illusion of being a sentient program/another server member, not for the purpose of trying to convince anyone it is an actual user but rather for it to take on a personality of its own.

Note: several files need to be updated and reviewed before uploading.

Functions:

```
1. !turing help - returns a list of commands
2. !turing meme - returns a random meme
3. !turing bless <user> - tag another user to bless them!
4. !turing curse <user> - tag another user to curse them!
5. !turing inspire - use a Markov chain to randomly generate an inspirational quote
6. !turnig conjugate <Spanish verb> - conjugate a Spanish verb; currently has limited support and does not handle irrgular verbs but improvements are on the way
7. !turing stock <stock ticker code> - return a candlestick chart of a stock
8. !turing encourage - returning an encouraging message (likely to become deprecated)
```
